## V63 — Unified General Agent Runtime

V63 turns JARVIS from a Purple-Team platform into a **general-purpose, local,
operator-controlled agent runtime** without losing any security capability. One
per-turn decision object drives everything, and every autonomous component is
bounded, gated, and resource-aware.

### Cross-cutting control planes

- **Operator Authority + Scope** (`core/authority.py`) — *Reasoning Freedom ≠
  Execution Authority.* JARVIS reasons freely about exploits, malware, and
  offensive technique; *acting on a target* is gated by an operator-selected
  authority mode (STANDARD / ADMIN_LOCAL / RESEARCH / CTF / TRUSTED_LAB /
  PURPLE_TEAM / INCIDENT_RESPONSE) and a fail-closed `ScopePolicy`. Out-of-scope
  or expired-scope target actions are refused before any challenge. Authority is
  server-side only — untrusted content can never widen it.

- **Typed Security Capability Registry** (`core/capabilities.py`) — an honest,
  gated inventory of external tooling. Availability/version probes report what is
  actually installed; shipped adapters (dns_lookup via nslookup, cert_inspect via
  openssl) build validated `shell=False` argv vectors, parse to structured
  results, capture hashed evidence artifacts, and route through
  `ToolExecutor.run_capability` (authority + risk/HITL + audit). Tools that are
  not present are inventory-only descriptors — never fake wrappers.

### Non-negotiable invariants

- **No bypass.** Every world-effect — specialist tool call, task-graph TOOL node,
  capability adapter — delegates to `ToolExecutor.aexecute` (risk class · HITL ·
  authority scope · audit). There is no `shell=True`, `os.system`, direct-MCP, or
  raw-handler path anywhere in the new runtime.
- **Bounded.** Agent teams, task graphs, blackboards, retries, and background
  work all have hard caps and timeouts; nothing fans out or loops unbounded.
- **Resource-aware.** Concurrency and background work back off under CPU/RAM
  pressure and on battery — the Rule of Silicon holds on the 15W host.
- **Fast path preserved.** Simple chat still routes `TaskDecision → direct
  inference`; teams/graphs/presence only engage when genuinely warranted.

---

## Configuration

All runtime behavior is driven by `jarvis_config.yaml` (auto-generated on
first launch). Priority order: **YAML > environment variables > defaults**.
Edits hot-reload on save — no restart required.

Telegram mobile bridge requires:

```
JARVIS_TELEGRAM_TOKEN   = <bot token from @BotFather>
JARVIS_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID = <your Telegram user ID from @userinfobot>
```

---

## Hardware Target

- CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 7430U (15W TDP, CPU-bound)
- RAM: 64GB DDR4 dual-channel
- All I/O, subprocesses, and inference are asynchronous to protect the
  main event loop. Heavy modules (Whisper, TTS, Torch) are lazy-loaded.

## V64 — Intelligence, Trust & Learning Fabric

V64 makes JARVIS *evidence-grounded, injection-resistant, and measurable*. It
adds a content-trust axis, a defense-in-depth injection firewall, evidence-first
research, and (later milestones) evaluation + curated failure datasets — the
scaffolding that must exist **before** any fine-tuning.

```
 User / Event / Agent Task → TaskDecision → Context Assembly
        │
        ▼
   Trusted Research Runtime (M11)         core/research_runtime.py
        │  query decomposition → search plan → source discovery
        ▼
   Source Trust Policy (M10)              core/source_trust.py
   PRIMARY · TRUSTED_SECONDARY ·          domain rules + structural signals,
   COMMUNITY · UNTRUSTED · BLOCKED        operator allow/blocklist, reputation
        │
        ▼
   Fetch / Retrieve → Prompt Injection Firewall (M12)   core/injection_firewall.py
        │  6 layers: source-trust · lexical · semantic (de-obfuscation) ·
        │  context-role · tool-isolation · memory-write
        ▼
   Claim Extraction → Cross-Source Correlation → Evidence Blackboard
        │
        ▼
   Specialist Agents → Critic → Verifier → Cited Synthesis
        │
        ▼
   Eval Logger (M14) → Failure Repository (M16) → Curated Dataset
        → LoRA/SFT (M17) → Offline Evals → Promotion Gate → Model Registry
```

### Cross-cutting: three orthogonal trust axes

JARVIS now distinguishes **three** independent trust questions, each with its own
module — none is a substitute for another:

| Axis | Question | Module |
|------|----------|--------|
| Execution trust | May this *command* run without a challenge? | `core/trust_engine.py` |
| Authority/scope | May we *act on this target*? | `core/authority.py` |
| **Content trust** | How much should this *source/data* be believed & obeyed? | `core/source_trust.py` + `core/injection_firewall.py` |

### M10 — Trusted Source Registry (`core/source_trust.py`)

Deterministic, pure classification of a fetched URL into a `SourceTrustTier`.
Operator blocklist is absolute; allowlist overrides; **unknown ⇒ UNTRUSTED**
(never COMMUNITY). Structural caps (IP host, non-HTTPS, firewall injection flag)
only ever *lower* a tier — reputation is a soft ranking prior and never promotes.
`CitationRecord` is valid only if the source was *actually fetched* (no invented
citations); critical claims require an authoritative source **and** ≥2 distinct
corroborations. Operator-only config knobs (`source_trust_allowlist/blocklist`,
`source_require_https`), env/.env only.

### M12 — Prompt Injection Firewall (`core/injection_firewall.py`)

**Origin-aware** defense-in-depth. The same text is a benign question from
`OPERATOR_INPUT` but an attack from `WEB_UNTRUSTED`; the firewall combines
attack-typed lexical + semantic detection (NFKC + zero-width strip + base64/hex
de-obfuscation) with a `TrustOrigin`, so benign mentions are not quarantined
while real injections are. **Enforcement is structural, not detection-dependent:**

- Untrusted/ingested content can **never** authorize a tool call
  (`tool_influence_allowed` is False for every non-operator/non-system origin).
- Firewall-flagged untrusted content is **never persisted** to memory
  (`memory_fabric.store` refuses it — stored/second-order injection defense).
- The firewall **cannot** mutate authority or scope — it imports nothing from
  `core.authority` and never calls `set_mode`/`add_scope` (test-asserted).

Wired at the single tool-loop choke point (`llm.py::_label_tool_result`, covering
both local **and** MCP results — MCP is now correctly labeled untrusted) and at
the memory-write path. High-severity untrusted content is quarantined
(replaced with a neutral, observable stub) even at moderate confidence.

### M11 — Trusted Research Runtime (`core/research_runtime.py`)

Evidence-grounded research that **drives** existing pieces rather than adding
parallel infra: query decomposition → source discovery → **M10** trust
classification → fetch (guarded `ToolExecutor.aexecute`, never raw `requests`) →
**M12** injection scan → claim extraction → `SharedBlackboard` evidence →
cross-source correlation → conflict detection → optional verifier → cited
synthesis. Emits a structured `ResearchResult` (claims, evidence, sources,
conflicts, confidence, unresolved_questions, citations).

Guarantees: **no invented citations** (a `CitationRecord` exists only for an
actually-fetched source), bounded queries/sources/content, BLOCKED sources are
never fetched, and injected pages are **quarantined and excluded from evidence**
(never become a claim). The claim/correlate/conflict/synthesis stages are pure,
so a research run is reproducible offline (no live Ollama/network) — search/fetch
are injectable; production attaches them to the guarded executor at boot
(`attach_research_runtime` in `main.py`) with the fail-closed verifier as the
verify hook.

### M14 — Evaluation Harness (`core/eval_harness.py`)

The measurement layer that MUST exist **before** any fine-tuning. Runs versioned
`EvalCase` JSONL datasets against any *target* (a turn, a research run, the
firewall, the analyzer) that conforms to a small output contract, scores each
case **deterministically wherever possible** (model-graded only when a `rubric`
demands it), and emits reproducible JSON/JSONL results with baseline comparison
and regression detection. Only the dimensions a case *specifies* are scored, so a
case with no ground truth simply skips correctness (no false failures).

Reuses `CriticEngine` + `VerificationResult` (no second scorer) — and adds the
`CriticEngine` regression-floor tests it never had. `compare_runs` reports
per-metric **and** pass-rate deltas, so nothing is ever "looks better": a change
is only promotable when it does not regress. Seeded set:
`evals/prompt_injection/injection_resistance.jsonl` — the M12 firewall scores a
measured **100%** resistance on the adversarial set (attacks quarantined, benign
controls not false-positived). Timeouts and target exceptions fail closed to a
failed case; one bad case never aborts the suite.

*GENESIS — v46.0. The collection of subsystems became one thing: JARVIS.*

*V63 — the one thing became a general agent: bounded, gated, resource-aware,
operator-controlled.*

*V64 — the general agent learned what to trust: evidence-grounded,
injection-resistant, and measurable.*
